  # as a float (i.e. 3.1); the patch version of Solidus should not be included.
  # If TargetSolidusVersion is not set, RuboCop will parse the Gemfile.lock or
  # gems.locked file to find the version of Solidus that has been bound to the
  # application.  If neither of those files exist, RuboCop will use Solidus 3.0
  # as the default.
